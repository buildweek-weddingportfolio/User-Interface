## What is Wedding Gram?

As a couple, when you first enter the site you can immediately view the weddings being planned around you- without having to  log in or create an account. If you're a wedding planner, it's also just as simple. Create a account, go to your dashboard, and quickly add new wedding events from the get-go. No need to write an elaborate blogpost or upload slideshows worth of images: just create a post and share it!
